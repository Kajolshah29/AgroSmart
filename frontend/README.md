# AgroSmart

## Motivation

Farmers often struggle with unfair pricing, lack of market access, and delayed payments. Middlemen reduce farmers' earnings, and buyers can't easily verify produce quality or origin. Traditional systems lack trust and transparency.

Blockchain can fix this by enabling direct, transparent trades between farmers and buyers. AI can make the platform simple and smart, especially for rural users.

## About
